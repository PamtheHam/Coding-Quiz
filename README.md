# Coding-Quiz

In this project, I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create a timed quiz that will test your Javascript fundamentals. The user has 100 seconds to answer five questions about JavaScript fundamentals. If the user selects an incorrect answer, then 10 seconds is subtracted from the overall time.
